## Instructions

* Zip the repository (decide whether or not to include the answers).
* Share the zipped repo with the students as well as the explanations below.
* Tell the students to check out the video explanation for the [Quantitative Genetics practical](https://github.com/rscherrer/evo-bio-cc-quantitative-genetics-practical).

## For students

* Download the zipped folder sexual-selection-practical.zip.
* Unzip it: it should contain an HTML file called "questions.html" and a folder named "functions".
* Open the HTML file in your browser: it contains all the questions of the practical. Just follow through!
* You will need R in this practical. Open RStudio, and make sure to set your working directory to the folder you have just downloaded ("sexual-selection-practical"). * This way, R will know where to find the functions that you will be using in this practical.
* Hint: to run chunks of code, simply copy and paste them into your R console within RStudio.
